# Synthetic-data

Installation of BlenderProc: 

```conda create -n synth python=3.10

conda activate synth

pip install blenderproc

blenderproc quickstart
```


### EDA results:
tweezers have only one material to work cand change, whilst the needle holder has two ptoperties that can vary.


Note: change location, scale, and rotation!


### Saving the dataset - correct format
For 2D pose estimation with two object classes (needle holder and tweezers) and synthetic data youâ€™re generating yourself, the trick is to save the dataset in one general, model-agnostic format so you can later convert it to whatever a specific model requires.
That way, you only do the annotation once and can reformat as needed.
